<body><font size="+1"><div align="center">  Back around 1993 I bought a little truck. It was a 1970 Chevy Luv. 
At the<br> just wanted something american. After owning a
 Voltswagon Rabbit and a Mazda RX, <br>which because they were both 
foreign and parts and labor cost so much, I wanted<br> something that 
was a little less expensive to maintain. Little did I know that 
<br>Chevrolet had nothing to do with Chevy luvs.<br> Anyway, I bought the 
truck for $900.00. It was a cute little thing. It had a <br>real nice 
paint job and a roll bar and I thought I was getting a pretty 
good deal. <br>But about a week later it lost compression and I was 
lucky if I could get it to go fast <br>enough to shift into third gear. 
 That's when I found out that it was an Isuzu and<br> Chevrolet had 
nothing to do with it. 

I remember a friend of mine and I were <br>driving that truck across 
town one day and we were passed up by a moped because<br> it wouldn't 
go fast enough to get out of second gear. It was embarrassing to 
say<br> the least. So I parked it and there it sat.<p><center> 

About two weeks later I was giving someone a ride to their friends 
apartment and when I <br>pulled up to drop them off the guy said "just 
drop me off by that 280z". We pulled up behind a black car <br>that had 
a rear spoiler. He said it was his friends and it needed a new engine. 
When I got close enough I<br> noticed it wasn't a 280z but an RX-7. I 
asked him if his friend would be interested in swapping titles<br> 
straight across for my truck. Like I said, that truck had a nice 
paint job and I knew it was appealing, <br>especially to a guy. I went 
and got the truck that same night. It took awhile to get it to his 
complex <br>because it wouldn't go over 25 mph. but when the guy saw it, 
it was a done deal.<p> 

When I first talked to the guy about the car he told me it needed new 
"rings'. Since<br> RX's have 'seals' rather then rings I thought, well 
more like hoped, that he was wrong. But, <br>though he was wrong about 
the rings, he was right about it needing a new engine. When the seals 
go<br> on an RX, it smokes. And let me tell you, this car smoked...bad. 

<p>I had to tow that car every time I moved (and I moved alot). Though 
it ran <br>it couldn't be driven because it would leave a cloud of smoke 
so thick you couldn't see <br>behind you. After awhile it became more of 
a hassle then it seemed to be worth so I decided to<br> check out one of 
those 'We buy cars, running or not' ads I saw in the paper. 

I talked to a guy <br>who said he wouldn't be able to give me what it was 
worth but said he had a friend who specialized<br> in Mazda's and rotary 
engines. I called the guy and within two weeks I had my car...<p>

<p align="center"><p> </p>I lived out of my car, on and off, for a few years. I would go to 
different friends<br> houses to take showers and such. Though I, 
eventually, had the engine rebuilt, everything else<br> would take it's 
turn needing replacement. I new a few people at a junk yard so I 
spent alot of time<br> out there. 

One particular time it was the starter. I took the starter out, 
and because there wasn't <br>another one available at the time, I drove 
it without one, which meant I had to make sure I parked <br>on a hill or 
in an area with room enough to push start it. That was one bonus 
having an RX, I could <br>push start it by myself. 

One day I went to a friends house to take a shower. I parked my 
car on the <br>right side of this guys trailer not knowing that it 
was the neighbors parking space. Everyone there saw<br> me park and 
nobody said a thing. Nor did anyone mention the on going feud between 
those neighbors<br> and the guy who owned the trailer. I was in the shower 
when the neighbors got home. The shower was<br> on the same side of the 
trailer as the neighbors parking spot so when they got home I heard 
yelling and screaming coming from outside, right where my car was. 
I was already having a bad day, and at that <br>period in my life I had 
alot of those, so most of the time I wasn't surprised when something 
went <br>wrong. but....<p> 

When I heard all the yelling I jumped out of the shower, got dressed 
and ran outside to <br>see what was up. 

When I got out there this little old man was standing behind my car 
cursing and <br>his little old lady wife was there with a phone in her 
hand calling the police. The old man wasn't going<br> to let me move my 
car till the cops got there. At the time I had traffic warrants out 
for me and my car,<br> as usual, had no insurance, no registration and 
fictitious plates. Even though I had never been there <br>before, and 
didn't know I wasn't supposed to park there these old people were not 
going to let me <br>go before the cops got there. I was freaking...
 
<p>While everyone else was standing around screaming at each other I was 
trying to push my <br>car out of the driveway so I could push start it 
and get the hell out of there before the cops got there.<br> 

I had pulled in forward so I had to push it out before I could push 
forward to start it but the old man <br>wouldn't move from behind my car.
I started pushing it backward anyway. The little old lady came <br>around 
to the front where I was, got in my face and started hitting me and 
screaming that I wasn't <br>leaving till the police got there. She was 
daring me to lay a finger on her but I don't hit old people,<br> so I was 
blocking her punches while I pushed my car out to where it could be 
push started. 

It was<br> far from easy but I did it. And I could still hear those 
old people screaming as I drove away. <p></p>
