<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I moved to Las Vegas in 1981. I had been there three times before, twice, for a couple of days, when I was 16, and the third time, for about a month, when I was 17. But this time, I planned on staying. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved everything about Vegas. It was overwhelming... The lights, the people, the money... It was an adult playground, in the middle of the desert, where you could party 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and the sky's the limit... If you're at least 21 years old, that is. Unfortunately, I was only 19, so my limits were a little closer to the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those limits had to do with employment. Since Vegas is made up of mostly casinos, my first job was at a Wendy's hamburger place. You know, home of the "Hot And Juicy" hamburger? Employees' even got a giant button, with the words "Hot And Juicy" in big, black, bold letters to wear. Might as well have been wearing a sign that said "Demeaning, sexual comments welcomed".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't wait until my 21st birthday. But not because I wanted to gamble. When I was sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, etc., I didn't look sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, etc., so I could already get away with gambling. What I couldn't do in a casino was work. And that was where the money was. Not slinging burgers for minimum wage. Which, by the way, was $3.35 an hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was 22 when I started Dealers school to learn how to deal Blackjack. God, it was so exciting... me... a Blackjack Dealer in 'Las Vegas'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a year I was dealing at a major strip resort, The Frontier Hotel and Casino. It was the job of a lifetime. The kind every Dealer strives for. The kind of opportunity that only comes along once... And there I was... and in less than a year.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siegfried &amp; Roy, before they left to perform at the Mirage Hotel and Casino, were still performing there at that time. The "tokes" (tips) were averaging at least $80 a night, Sunday through Thursday, and $200 a night, on Fridays and Saturdays. I couldn't believe how great things were going. I remember leaving work one night thinking&nbsp; "something is going to happen cause I am just too happy...".<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've heard the saying, "live and learn", right? Well, I never got the chance to find out about the "live" part, but when it comes to learning, Vegas can be a very dark, un-caring, and un-forgiving place.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gaming industry back then, Dealers were, pretty much, the only employees that did not have a union. Most casino businesses worked on a</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; "Who you know..."<br />and a<br />"Last one hired, first one fired..."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">basis. So if, for example, the boss's daughter wanted a job there, usually the last one hired, was the first to go. So when such a situation arose, I was the last hired, so I was the first to go, and I didn't take it very well...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was living by myself at the time. Being so young, I was slightly stupid and a bit naive, and since I could make my rent in one day, two at the most, I was kind of carefree and spendy with my money. In other words, I didn't usually save any. So when I was "let go", I didn't have any saved. I lost my apartment, my car, and most of my stuff. That is when the depression set in... and it hit me like a freight train... <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really hate to cry... and it seemed like that's all I did. The only time I wasn't was when I was asleep. If you're asleep, you don't think, if you don't think, you are not depressed... But you can only sleep so much... That's why I started drinking...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drinking is easy, and usually free, in Nevada, especially if you're a female. That meant I could go anywhere in Vegas and drink for nothing. That made drinking a very easy, and for me, free, way not to think, thus, easing the depression. Problem solved... or so I thought.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I wasn't much of a drinker, it would only take one beer to give me a buzz. But after only a week of drinking, all day, everyday, I'd be lucky if I got a buzz after a 6 pack. I wasn't paying for them, so I didn't care how many it took, cause if I was buzzed, I wasn't depressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day the space shuttle blew up, in 1986, I went to this little bar, near where I was staying to, what else... drink! There, I met this guy, whom I later married, and we started seeing each other. He had a brother who lived in Minnesota, so we decided to move up there. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Minnesota, the beer has only half the alcohol content as beer in Nevada. So instead of getting a buzz off of six beers, it took twelve of them. I was quickly turning into a lush.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guy I went up there with, his name is Mike, and I, decided to go back to Vegas. We'd stay with Mike's mother until we'd saved enough to get a place of our own.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We both got a job, working together, at a car wash, making minimum wage and about $7 to $10 a day in tips, which was a far cry from what I was making dealing cards.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, to most, it's common knowledge that people gain weight from drinking beer, as with drinking or eating anything. But what some people, like me, did not know is that the weight a person gains from drinking beer is nothing compared to the inches that it puts on... That was until my uncle came to Vegas to visit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four of us, me, Mike, my uncle and his wife, went downtown to have our picture taken in front of the million dollars at The Horseshoe Casino. When I saw that picture, I felt like crying... again! My thighs looked almost as big around as a Sparklets water bottle, give or take an inch or two. It was a very rude awakening. That's when I decided to quit drinking, straighten up, and get back into dealing cards again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it had been about a year since I had dealt, I was pretty nervous. That's because Dealers do not apply, they "audition". That means you deal a few hands on a live game, and if you don't make any mistakes, you will usually get the job. I auditioned at the Nevada Palace Hotel and Casino and was hired.</p>
