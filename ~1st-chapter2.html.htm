After owning a Voltswagon Rabbit and a Mazda RX, which because they<p> were both foreign and parts and labor cost so much, I wanted something that was a little less expensive to maintain. Little did I know that Chevrolet had nothing to do with Chevy luvs. Anyway, I bought the truck for $900.00. It was a cute little thing. It had a real nice paint job and a roll bar and I thought I was getting a pretty good deal. But about a week later it lost compression and I was lucky if I could get it to go fast enough to shift into third gear.  That's when I found out that it was an Isuzu and Chevrolet had nothing to do with it. I remember a friend of mine and I were driving that truck across town one day and we were passed up by a moped because it wouldn't go fast enough to get out of second gear. It was embarrassing to say the least. So I parked it and there it sat. About two weeks later I was giving someone a ride to their friends apartment and when I pulled up to drop them off the guy said "just drop me off by that 280z". We pulled up behind a black car that had a rear spoiler. He said it was his friends and it needed a new engine. When I got close enough I noticed it wasn't a 280z but an RX-7. I asked him if his friend would be interested in swapping titles straight across for my truck. Like I said, that truck had a nice paint job and I knew it was appealing, especially to a guy. I went and got the truck that same night. It took awhile to get it to his complex because it wouldn't go over 25 mph. but when the guy saw it, it was a done deal. When I first talked to the guy about the car he told me it needed new "rings'. Since RX's have 'seals' rather then rings I thought, well more like hoped, that he was wrong. But, though he was wrong about the rings, he was right about it needing a new engine. When the seals go on an RX, it smokes. And let me tell you, this car smoked...bad. I had to tow that car every time I moved (and I moved alot). Though it ran it couldn't be driven because it would leave a cloud of smoke so thick you couldn't see behind you. After awhile it became more of a hassle then it seemed to be worth so I decided to check out one of those 'We buy cars, running or not' ads I saw in the paper. I talked to a guy who said he wouldn't be able to give me what it was worth but said he had a friend who specialized in Mazda's and rotary engines. I called the guy and within two weeks I had my car...<p><p><p align="center"><p> </p>I lived out of my car, on and off, for a few years. I would go to different friends houses to take showers and such. Though I, eventually, had the engine rebuilt, everything else would take it's turn needing replacement. I new a few people at a junk yard so I spent alot of time out there. One particular time it was the starter. I took the starter out, and because there wasn't another one available at the time, I drove it without one, which meant I had to make sure I parked on a hill or in an area with room enough to push start it. That was one bonus having an RX, I could push start it by myself. One day I went to a friends house to take a shower. I parked my car on the right side of this guys trailer not knowing that it was the neighbors parking space. Everyone there saw me park and nobody said a thing. Nor did anyone mention the on going feud between those neighbors and the guy who owned the trailer. I was in the shower when the neighbors got home. The shower was on the same side of the trailer as the neighbors parking spot so when they got home I heard yelling and screaming coming from outside, right where my car was. I was already having a bad day, and at that period in my life I had alot of those, so most of the time I wasn't surprised when something went wrong. but.. When I heard all the yelling I jumped out of the shower, got dressed and ran outside to see what was up. When I got out there this little old man was standing behind my car cursing and his little old lady wife was there with a phone in her hand calling the police. The old man wasn't going to let me move my car till the cops got there. At the time I had traffic warrants out for me and my car, as usual, had no insurance, no registration and fictitious plates. Even though I had never been there before, and didn't know I wasn't supposed to park there these old people were not going to let me go before the cops got there. I was freaking... While everyone else was standing around screaming at each other I was trying to push my car out of the driveway so I could push start it and get the hell out of there before the cops got there. I had pulled in forward so I had to push it out before I could push forward to start it but the old man wouldn't move from behind my car.I started pushing it backward anyway. The little old lady came around to the front where I was, got in my face and started hitting me and screaming that I wasn't leaving till the police got there. She was daring me to lay a finger on her but I don't hit old people, so I was blocking her punches while I pushed my car out to where it could be push started. It was far from easy but I did it. And I could still hear those old people screaming as I drove away. </p> ---------------------------------------------------------------- /div></body></html>
