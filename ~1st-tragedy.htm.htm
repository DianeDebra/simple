I had been there three times before, twice, for a couple of days, when I was 16,<br> and the third time, for about a month, when I was 17.<br> But this time, I planned on staying.<br><br>    I loved every thing about Vegas. It was overwhelming...<br> The lights, the people, the money. An adult playground,<br> in the middle of the desert, where you could party 24 hours<br> a day, 7 days a week.. and the sky's the limit... if you're at<br> least 21 years old, that is...</div><p align="center"></p> <div align="center">  <p>Unfortunately I was only 19, so my limits were a little closer to the ground..</p>  <p><img src="pics/mewendys.JPG">       </p>  </p>  <p>One of those limits had to do with employment. Since Vegas is made up of mostly casinos, my first<br> job was at a Wendy's hamburger place.  You know, home of the "Hot And Juicy" hamburger...<br> Employees' even got a giant button, with the words "Hot And Juicy", in big, black, bold letters, to<br> wear.. Might as well have been wearing a sign that said  "Demeaning, Sexual Comments Welcomed.."<br><br>    I couldn't wait until my 21st birthday, but not because I wanted to gamble.<br> When I was sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, ect., I didn't look sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, ect.,<br> so I could already gamble... What I couldn't do was work, in a casino... and that was where<br> the money was. Not slinging burgers for minimum wage. Which, by the way, was $3.35 an hour.<br><br>      I was 22 when I started dealers school to learn to deal Blackjack.<br>  <br>    <img src="pics/dealscool.gif"><br>   God, it was so exciting.. me.. a Blackjack Dealer in 'Las Vegas'...<br>     With in a year I was dealing at a major strip resort, The<br> Frontier Hotel and Casino. It was the job of a lifetime. The kind<br> every Dealer strives for. The kind of opportunity that only comes<br> along once... And there I was... and in less then a year..<br>    <br> Siegfried & Roy, before they left to perform at the<br> Mirage Hotel and Casino, were still performing there at that time.<br> The tokes (tips) were averaging at least $80 a night, Sunday through<br> Thursday, and $200 a night, on Fridays and Saturdays.</p></div><p align="center"></p> <div align="center">I was so...for lack of a better, more discriptive word, happy..<br> but "happy",  doesn't even come close, to describing the way I was<br> feeling... about my life... about my future... about myself... Maybe if<br> you added exultant, jubilant, ecstatic, and content, you might get<br> some of an idea...<br> You've heard the saying, "live and learn", right? Well, I don't really<br> know the "live" part, but when it comes to the learning, Vegas can be a <br>very dark, un-caring and un-forgiving place.</div><p align="center">     In the gaming industry, dealers are, pretty much, the only<br> employees that do not have a union.    Most casino businesses work on a<br> <b><i>"..who you know.."</i></b> and a  <b><i>"last one hired, first one fired..",</i></b><br>  basis. So if, for example, the bosses daughter wanted to work there, usually,<br> the last one hired, was the first to go. So when such a situation arose,<br> I was the last hired, so I was the first to go. and I didn't take it very well at all...<br><br>	 I was living by myself at the time. Being so young, I was slightly stupid and<br> a bit naive, and since I could make my rent in one, or two days, at most, I was<br> kind of carefree and spendy with my money. In other words, I didn't usually<br> save any. So when I was let go, I didn't have any saved. I lost my apartment,<br> my car, and most of my stuff. That is when the depression<br> set in... and it hit me like a freight train..<br><br> It seemed like all I did was cry. I'd fall asleep crying, I'd wake up  crying,<br> and then cry the whole day. The only time I wasn't crying, was when I was<br> asleep... if you're asleep, you don't think... if you don't think, you're not<br> depressed.. but you can only sleep so much.. That's why I started drinking...<br> Drinking is easy, and usually free, in Nevada, especially if you're<br> a female. That meant I could go anywhere in Vegas and drink for nothing.<br> That made drinking a very easy, and for me, free, way not to think, thus, easing<br> the depression... problem solved...or so I thought.<br><br>        Because I wasn't much of a drinker, it would only take one beer to give<br> me a buzz. But after drinking everyday, all day, at the end of the first week, I'd be lucky if<br> I got a buzz after a 6 pack.  I wasn't paying for them, so I didn't care how many it took,<br> cause if I was buzzed, I wasn't depressed..<br><br>   On the day the space shuttle blew up, in 1986, I went to this little bar,<br> near where I was staying, to, what else... drink!<br>      There, I met this guy, whom I later married, and we started seeing each other. He had a<br> brother who lived in Minnesota, so we decided to move up there.    In Minnesota, the beer has only<br> half the alcohol content as beer in Nevada. So instead of getting a buzz off of 6 beers, it took 12<br> of them. I was quickly turning into a lush.<br>    The guy I went up there with, his name is Mike, and I, decided to go<br> back to Vegas. We'd stay with Mikes mother until we saved enough to get a place of our own.<br>   We both got a job, working together, at a car wash, making minimum<br> wage and about $7 to $10 a day in tips... which was a far cry from what I was making dealing cards.<br>It's common knowledge, that people gain weight from drinking beer, as with drinking or eating anything. But what some people, like me, might not know is, that the weight a person gained from drinking beer, is nothing compared to the inches that it puts on...<br> That was until my uncle came to Vegas to visit.   The four of us (me, Mike,<br> my uncle and his wife) went to have our picture taken in front of the million<br> dollars at the Horseshoe Casino.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="pics/horseshoe.jpg"><br>    When I saw that picture I felt like crying... again. My thighs looked almost as big around as a Sparklets water bottle (give or take an inch or two). It was the biggest I had ever been, without being pregnant. It was a very rude awakening.    That is when I decided to quit drinking, straighten up and get back into dealing cards again.</div><p align="center"></p>    <div align="center">It had been about a year since I had dealt, so I was pretty nervous. That's<br> because dealers do not apply for a position,  they 'audition'  for a position. That<br> means, you deal a few hands on a live game and if you don't make any mistakes, you will usually get the job.    I auditioned at the Nevada Palace Hotel and Casino, and was hired.</div><p align="center"></p>    <div align="center">I was pretty proud of myself. After, quickly, going from one beer a month, to, at least, a six-pack a day, within a matter of a week, then spending the remainder of the year, drunk, I, alone, was able to pull myself out of a devastating, self-destructing slump.<br>    I guess you could say...  I fell off my horse, picked myself up, brushed myself off and got right back on...   You might think that would be the end of my story, and I lived happily ever after... but...</div><p align="center"></p>   <div align="center">My boyfriend and I were working different shifts. I was working swing,<br> 8pm to 4am, and he worked grave at the Showboat Hotel and Casino,<br> which has since been imploded, 3am to 11am. Since we only<br> had one car, he would drop me at work, then take the car home.<br> When he went to work, he would park the car across the street.<br> After I got off, I'd get a ride to the Showboat, get the car and come<br> back to pick him up when he got off.</div><p align="center"></p>   <div align="center">On May 21, 1987, about two months after I started dealing again, I was<br> just getting back into the swing of things, getting my confidence back, you know,<br> stuff like that. I got off about 4am, or so, and got a ride to the Showboat to get the<br> car, but for some reason it wouldn't start. I tried it a few times, but nothing. The<br> battery started to sound a little week, so I decided to go across the street, play a<br> couple of quarters, and let it sit for a few, then come back out and try again.<br>   I was in the Showboat about two hours, I had lost sixty bucks and only saw the<br> cocktail waitress twice, which kind of pissed me off, cause that meant it cost me $60<br> for two drinks. That's when I figured I better just go out and try starting the car again before I lost all of my money.</div><p align="center"></p>    <div align="center">The last thing I remember, is walking out the front exit doors of the Showboat,<br> and saying to my boyfriend  "if it doesn't start, I'll be back...".   Then, it was like I<br> blinked, and when I opened my eyes, I was in the hospital, I had a cast on my leg,<br> double vision, and all these tubes and monitors, hooked up to me. But the hardest<br> thing for me to believe, was that it was six days later.. (talk about waking up and not knowing where you are or how you got there)...</div><p align="center"></p>   <div align="center">This is how I got there... or at least what I was told...</div><p align="center"></p>    <div align="center">When I left the Showboat, I started to cross the street, and was hit by a<br> 1986 Ford Ranger, going 55 mph. I was thrown one hundred and fifty feet. He hit<br> me so hard, it knocked me right out of both my shoes.    The front license plate broke<br> my leg, which explained the cast.., the right side of my head hit the ground first,<br> paralyzing a nerve in my left eye, which explained why I had, and still have, double<br> vision.., and the pain I was going through must have been so severe, that I blocked it<br> out. Which could explain why I couldn't, and still can't, remember any of it.<br>   I was flown, by Flight for Life, to Valley hospital, where I spent the first few days in intensive care...</div><p align="center"></p>  <p align="center">My story doesn't end there, but I have to take a break... If you're still interested in hearing the rest, come back and see me...and thank you for listening...<font size="-1"></p><p align="center"><br></p><div align="center">******************************************<br>  <br><div align="center"><font size="+1">On to<p> <div align="center"><font size="+2"><a href="anotherchapter.htm"><font color="3333ff">   Another chapter</a></font><br>  </div><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><br>  <font size="-1"><i></div><br>
