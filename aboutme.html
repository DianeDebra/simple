<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A bit about me</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I've always been a shy and self-conscious person. At times I can be overly sensitive and I get embarrassed pretty easily. Because I cared what people thought about me, I would wear a pair of shoes that killed my feet because they looked good before I'd wear a comfortable pair that looked stupid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyeglasses, on me anyway, are in the same category as stupid-looking shoes. I got my first pair of glasses when I was in about the 4th grade. My father was in the Marine Corps so I changed schools a lot. At the beginning of my 5th grade year my family moved to Camp Pendleton, in California. Since it was a new school, and none of the kids had ever seen me before, I decided to wear my glasses thinking if the other kids were to see me the first time with glasses on, I wouldn't look so funny. But by lunchtime those kids made so much fun of me that I took them off and never wore them in public again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since most of the teachers wrote lessons and homework on the blackboard, and because I wouldn't wear my glasses outside of my house, I had trouble keeping up my grades. The last full year I completed was my freshman year of high school. After that I went back and forth between Boron High School in Boron, California, and Mojave High School, 30 miles away, in Mojave, California. I would've graduated in 1980. But instead got my G.E.D. in 1979.</p>
